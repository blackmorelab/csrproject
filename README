Contains Code to reproduce figures from the paper
'Genome-wide association between transcription factor expression and chromatin accessibility reveals chromatin state regulators'. by D. Lamparter et al.
To run all steps, call 'Code/compltetePipeline.sh'.
while it should allow to replicate 
results with relative ease it's not guaranteed to work out-of-the-box. 
notworthy failure points are installation of R packages, external software and download of external data.
Be warned: some of the steps are computationally very intensive.
A second pipeline (script 'Code/pipelineWithoutPreprocessing.R') is available that skips preprocessing. 
It usesprecomputed data matrix in folder PreprocessedData/ .
Results are saved folder 'PaperDocs/.'.
